## Arrow Functions
Arrow functions in JavaScript are a concise way to write functions. They were introduced in ES6 and provide a shorter syntax compared to traditional function expressions.

Here's an example of an arrow function:

Implicit return: If the function body consists of a single expression, you can omit the curly braces and the return keyword. The result of the expression will be automatically returned.

```js
const getYear = (year) => year.split("-")[0]; //Implicit return
const getYear2 = (year) => {return year.split("-")[0]}; //Here return is required

console.log(getYear("2012-12-12")) // 2012
console.log(getYear2("2012-12-12")) // 2012
```
