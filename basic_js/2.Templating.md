## Template Literals
Template literals, also known as template strings, are a feature in JavaScript that allows for more flexible and readable string interpolation. They are enclosed in backticks (`) instead of single quotes or double quotes.

Template literals can contain placeholders, indicated by the dollar sign and curly braces (${expression}). These placeholders can contain any valid JavaScript expression, and their values are inserted into the resulting string.

Here's an example:
```js
const name = 'Alice';
const age = 25;

const message = `My name is ${name} and I am ${age} years old.`;

console.log(message);
```
