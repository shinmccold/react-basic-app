## Coalescing Operator

``??`` Is a coalescing operation in java.
In JavaScript, the nullish coalescing operator (??) is used to provide a default value when the left-hand side operand is null or undefined.

```js
const book = {
  author: null
};

const authorName = book.author ?? "Unknown";
console.log(authorName); // Output: "Unknown"
```

## Optional Chaining

In optional chaining javascript wont throw error it will evaluate till a.b.c.d if 'e' is not present then we use coalescing operation (??) to get a default value
```js

const count = a.b.c.d?.e ?? 0;

```
