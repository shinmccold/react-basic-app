## Coalescing Operator

``??`` Is a coalescing operation in java.
In JavaScript, the nullish coalescing operator (??) is used to provide a default value when the left-hand side operand is null or undefined.

```js
const book = {
  author: null
};

const authorName = book.author ?? "Unknown";
console.log(authorName); // Output: "Unknown"
```
